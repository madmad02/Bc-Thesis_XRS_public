# Bc-Thesis XRS : public
These are the results of my bachelor thesis :: X-ray Spectroscopy of the Cosmic Web, and the code used within.

- The full thesis can be found at the Masaryk University webpage:

to be added :-)

- Note that the SOXS library used to simulate the X-ray spectra was edited and the instruments within it may not match the instruments used by default by SOXS.
- The TNG100-3 simulation volume was used as a base for our simulations. It can be downloaded at IllustrisTNG website:

- All the response files used to create simulated observations are mentioned in the thesis. Some (LEM, Chandra, XRISM) were obtained via the SOXS library. The NewAthena response files can be found at the X-IFU website:

- The HUBS response files are not available to the public.
- Guess, I am a fan of X-ray missions now. Go, counts, go! :-)
